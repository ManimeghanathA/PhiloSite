          Traditional Indian and Tibetan tantric anatomy tells us that in the
          middle of the human torso there are three channels (nādis or
          “streams”), one each on the left, middle, and right, and that these
          proceed vertically upward through a number of circular centres (cakras
          in standard Sanskrit transliteration, chakras in modern English
          spelling). This account of the “subtle body” (sūkṣma śarīra) has
          become popular in modern yoga and other forms of alternative medicine
          or spirituality. I don’t believe this account of the subtle body – but
          not primarily for the obvious reason. The obvious reason is that
          empirical anatomical studies of the body have never turned up any such
          channels or chakras. Perhaps the most important such studies were the
          ones conducted by medieval Tibetans – who, as they began dissecting
          and observing physical human bodies, did not find anything in them
          that looked like the tantric anatomy, even though that was what they
          were specifically looking for. If any empirical observers were to have
          observed channels or chakras inside physical bodies when they cut them
          up and opened them, it would have been the Tibetans – and they didn’t.
          For many scientifically minded observers, that would be enough. We
          open up bodies and find there are no chakras there, so there are no
          chakras, and there’s an end on’t. But that’s not the perspective I
          have taken. Janet Gyatso noted three ways that medieval Tibetan
          writers tried to preserve the tantric anatomy despite not observing it
          in physical bodies. Two of these (that that anatomy is actually found
          in an embryo or in the main trunk of the nervous system) I don’t find
          particularly compelling. But I am drawn to the view of Yangönpa
          Gyeltsen Pel, who thought that the tantric anatomy was invisible to
          the naked eye, and could only be seen through contemplative yogic
          practice. Yangonpa’s view appeals to me because I think there is a lot
          we do perceive about our own bodies through inner observation. When
          you have a stomach ache, you don’t perceive that through the
          traditional five senses. A decade’s worth of meditation practice has
          taught me to keenly observe inner feelings throughout my body, like
          the hot agitation in my stomach associated with anxiety or the forward
          momentum associated with anger. I think there is a subtle body of some
          sort because I’ve perceived it myself, and to some extent I think most
          people have as well. It just doesn’t have anything to do with the
          chakras and channels! I am not skeptical about the idea of a subtle
          body. Meditation has got me very sensitive to all of these inner
          feelings of heat and agitation and so on – ones that do not correspond
          to the traditional five senses, and may very well not correspond to
          anatomy either. I am primed to believe in a subtle body. I just see no
          reason to believe in that specific subtle body – the one found in
          channels within the centre of the torso. What I observe of the subtle
          body is concentrated in the front of the torso and neck, not in the
          middle, and without any significant division into left and right, or
          into vertical centres. It’s at the front where I feel the agitation,
          the anger, the fear within me. As far as I can tell, that’s where my
          subtle body is. This makes a big difference because, as far as I can
          tell, you’re supposed to be encountering the subtle body through
          meditation practice! That’s the point of the subtle body, is that you
          can perceive it directly in yourself – in a way in contrast to the
          anatomy of cutting someone up. It is traditional in Tibet to visualize
          the tantric anatomy – but that is not the same thing, you come in with
          an agenda where you’re already looking for it. I did not come in with
          that agenda, and I have not observed the thing. That makes me
          skeptical of it. Maybe I’d start perceiving it after looking for long
          enough. But human suggestibility is such that one can see many things
          after looking for them long enough. In the meditation I’ve practised,
          by contrast – Headspace and Goenka vipassanā – you are merely supposed
          to observe your breath and your bodily sensations. There’s nothing
          you’re supposed to find – except perhaps the bare fact of how hard it
          is to control your thoughts, which does not seem like the kind of
          thing one needs to go looking all that hard for. After a decade, it
          seems to me that if the chakras were really there even subtly, I would
          have found them. Basically, it seems to me, there are two ways one
          could understand the idea of a subtle body. One is that it is
          full-blown supernatural: that it is something objectively existent
          whether you perceive it or not, with causal efficacy in the world, but
          not detectable by any scientific instruments. (The Tibetan surgeons’
          surprise at not encountering it is important here.) My general
          skepticism to the supernatural is enough to give me a strong
          skepticism of that view. The second – the one that I think could be
          sustainable in a scientific world – is that it is something inherent
          in our subjectivity, that it structures our experience,
          phenomenologically. I’m amenable to that idea. It would have made me a
          believer in the tantric subtle body if I’d actually encountered it in
          my ten years’ worth of observing my internal feelings. But I didn’t!
